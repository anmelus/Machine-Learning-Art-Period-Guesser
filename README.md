# Machine-Learning-Art-Period-Guesser

The task for this project was to build a neural network model that is able to predict the artist of a painting after learning numerous previous works. This model was created as a chosen final project for ECE 542 - Neural Networks at NC State University hosted by Dr. Edgar Lobaton.

The full report for this project can be found at the [Project Report](https://github.com/anmelus/Machine-Learning-Artist-Guesser/blob/main/Project%20Report.pdf) on this repository. The dataset used was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time) and consists of around 16000+ different paintings from 50 artists. All of the ipynb notebooks were ran using Google Colab and their given GPUs. After training, our best accuracy result on the validation set was ~85%. Artists with less works had a much lower accuracy rating.
